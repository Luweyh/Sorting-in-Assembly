# Sorting Random Integers
Applies data structures in Assembly. Auto create 200 random integers which ranges from 10-29. The values are stored in arrays and then sorted by using count sort. Count sort is done so by iterating through the array and then starting at the lowest value 10 and storing all lowest values, before moving to the next value. It iterates through 19 times which will create a new array that is sorted. The program will show the original nubmers and then the sorted numbers in equal columns with 10 numbers in each line. It will also iterate through the array to find the median and since the array size is an even number, it will need to find the average of two middle number. Program also works with procedures and using it to moduralized the code.
